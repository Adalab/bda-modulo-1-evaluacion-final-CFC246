# bda-modulo-1-evaluacion-final-CFC246

Hi!
You are in Cristina Fern√°ndez's README of the first evaluation exercise of Module 1 of ADALAB's Data Analytics Bootcamp.

The aim of this final exercise is to create a class that works as a layout to build our own shop. This will give us an insight into what we need to improve in our learning process.

Let's learn and experiment! :)
