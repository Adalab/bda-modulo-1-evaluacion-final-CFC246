# bda-modulo-1-evaluacion-final-CFC246

Hi!
You are in Cristina Fern√°ndez's README of the first evaluation exercise of Module 1 of ADALAB's Data Analytics Bootcamp.

The aim of this final exercise is to create a class that works as a layout to build our own shop. This will give us an insight into what we need to improve in our learning process.

OnlineShop is the class we created to build our own:  ShopCFC246. As a plant lover, I chose succulents for my shop because they are the ones I have been able to keep alive the longest.

Let's learn and experiment! :)
